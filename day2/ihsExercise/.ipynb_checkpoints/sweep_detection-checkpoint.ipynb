    "# Detecting selective sweeps\n",

    "In this exercise we are going to get our hands dirty lookinag at population genetic signatures of adaptation. When a beneficial mutation occurs, it may rapidly spread through the population, resulting in a selective sweep. We talked a bit about this process in lecture, and how it impacts patterns of genetic diversity in the area around the selected mutation. In this exercise, we will learn how to use a statistic called _iHS_ to try detect recent selective sweeps. We will start with an overview of the method, then apply it to simulated data to see how it works, and then finally take it out for a spin on some real genomic data from a human population.\n",

    "At first this looks like some bad abstract art, but we can make sense of it. It is really just a representation of a population genetic alignment: the _x_-axis shows different SNPs, and each haplotype is shown as a separate row on the _y_-axis. But instead of looking at \"A\"s, \"C\"s, \"G\"s, and \"T\"s, we are representing genotypes by colors. The color scheme will make sense if we start at the center: the Test SNP. This is the SNP that we are testing for evidence of positive selection. Has it rapidly increased in frequency (i.e. is it involved in an ongoing selective sweep) or not? At the Test SNP, we have two alleles, the ancestral allele and the derived allele, which we will color as blue and red, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's focus on individuals with the ancestral allele (they are all colored blue at the Test SNP, and present in the top half of this figure), and let's move out to the right, looking at sites in the genome to the right of our Test SNP. At first, we see a column that is all blue--that is, all individuals with the ancestral/blue allele are our Test SNP are also identical to one another at these other sites to the right. However, we pretty quickly come to a point where some of our individuals are green. This is because we have reached a point where our individuals having the ancestral/blue allele at the Test SNP are no longer identical: at this site, there is a SNP where some of these individuals have the \"green\" allele, so we color them green, while most do not, and thus they remain blue. Note that the coloring here is arbitrary, green and blue could easily have been swapped with purple and orange or whatever, but the coloring has been done to simply highlight differences among individuals harboring the ancestral allele at our Test SNP. We press on, further to the right, and quickly find some more new colors popping up, representing more differences among individuals with the ancestral allele at the Test SNP. We see that as we move further and further away, we find more differences. This is because recombination and mutation events break up similarities among individuals, and the wider the genomic region you examine, the more opportunities for these events there have been.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's switch our focus to individuals with the derived allele (red). We again see that these individuals are all identical at the Test SNP, which must be the case by definition, and as we move further away we start to see some differences creep in. However, this takes a bit longer for the derived allele than it did for the ancestral allele: the genomic region where all or most of our individuals are colored red is larger than the size of the blue segment in the top half of the figure. This is because the derived allele is newer than the ancestral allele, so there hasn't been as much evolutionary time for new mutation and recombination events to introduce diversity into the subset of individuals that have the red allele. Moreover, this particular allele happens to be positively selected, and it has increased in frequency rather quickly, meaning we have had even less time for mutation and recombination events. We can see that there is a noticeable difference in the total size of the red portion of the bottom half of the plot and the total size of the blue portion in the top half of the plot, and this is a consequence of the rapid spread of the derived allele in this example. The magnitude of the difference between the red portion on the bottom plot and the blue portion on the top plot is in essence the information that _iHS_ is trying to capture. (This isn't exactly what _iHS_ measures, but that is enough of an explanation for now. If you want to see more detail on what exactly _iHS_ calculates, check out the paper: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040072).\n",

    "One commonly used model of demographic changes over the course of human history is Gutenkunst et al.'s (2009; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000695) model of the Out-of-Africa migration. This model contains three populations, an African population (abbreviated AFR below), a population of Han-Chinese individuals from Beijing (CHB), and a population of individuals of European ancestry from Utah (abbreviated CEU, with the C itself standing for another abbreviation, CEPH, which stands for Centre d′Etudes du Polymorphisme Humain, which created the dataset that this simulated subpopulation is based on. Ugh.).\n",

    "\n",
    "We looked at this model in the population genetics lectures. Briefly, it begins with an ancestral African population of 7300 individuals. Then, 220,000 years ago (assuming a generation time of 25 years), this population expands to 12,300 individuals---this change is noted to correspond roughly with the emergence of anatomically modern humans, but really this fact has no bearing on the model or the resulting simulations (only genomes are simulated---no phenotypes!). Later, the African population splits into two subpopulations (African and Eurasian) 140,000 years ago, with the initial size of the Eurasian population being 2,100 individuals. Much later, the Eurasian population itself splits into two subpopulations 21.2 thousand years ago, with the initial sizes of the resulting Asian and European populations being 510 and 1,000 individuals, respectively. These two subpopulations then experience expontential growth at rates of 0.4% and 0.55% per year, respectively, until the present day. The final sizes of the Asian and European populations are thus roughly 54,090 and 29,725 individuals, while the African population in this model has remained constant at 12,300 years. The model also includes migration between these subpopulations.\n",

One weird thing that you might notice about the table and code if you look closely is that it seems to be backwards. For example, the initial_size of CEU is 29725, when really that is the size at the present-day. This is because msprime is a coalescent simulator, which means that it simulates these individuals backwards in time until they \"coalesce\" into their most recent common ancestor, giving us a tree (or a tree sequence, when recombination occurs). Kinda weird, but this simulation approach is extremely fast. You can read more about msprime here: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004842."
