For today's exercise, we are again using a `jupyter` notebook. We are also using the `scikit-learn` package, which should already be installed on your `diploSHIC` environment. So, to get started, go ahead and activate that environment:

`conda activate diploSHIC`

Then, launch `jupyter`, use it to open the `practical1_iris_ML_playground.ipynb`, and get to it!
